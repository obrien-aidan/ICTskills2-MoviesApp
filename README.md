## App Design.

### Component catalogue.
![][stories]

### UI Design.

Filters:
*filters the mounted movies*
![][image1]

Upcoming Moves:
*returns a list of uncoming movies*
![][image2]

Search:
*allows the user to search the entire TMDB database by movie title*
![][image3]

Minor design change - headerMovieList design change:
*This component was altered to (what I feel) is a more modern design*
![][image4]

Minor design change - new favicon:
*I played around with designing my own favicon.ico to replace the default one*
![][image5]
![][image6]

### Routing.
All routes are public:
+ /movies/upcomingMovies - displays 20 upcoming movies
+ /searchMovies - allows user to search the entire TMDB database

## React feature set.
+ useState and useEffect hooks - src/pages/upcomingMovieList.js
+ useContext hook - src/context/movieContext.js
+ parameterized URL - src/components/searchMovies/index.js
+ statefull component - src/components/searchMovies/index.js
+ stateless component - src/components/upcomingMovies/index.js

## Independent learning.
Cloud deployment on VERCEL:
+ reference = https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel-cra

*I went down a rat hole when trying to implement filtering and sorting - I had initially tried this using TMDBs filters and sorting calls*
*but these were calling a new set of movies every time (as opposed to filtering/sorting the already mounted movies)*
*so I decided to change my approach and create JS functions to carrying out sorting and filtering which was meant I spent far less time working in React(and storybook) than I should have and more time working in/learning standard javascript*

I had to split the release date filter decade range into 2 individual values:
+ reference = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
